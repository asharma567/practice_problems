I would like to have a program that takes in a phone number, and returns the 'mnemonics' that might be associated with it. Mnemonics are letters that people can use to remember numbers, such as 555-4 PIZZA

The following numeric-to-character correspondances exist:

1 - '1'
2 - abc
3 - def
4 - ghi
5 - jkl
6 - mno
7 - pqrs
8 - tuv
9 - wxyz
0 - '0'

Numbers can also stand for themselves.  How would you build this?
